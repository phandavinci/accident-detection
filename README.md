# ACCIDENT-DETECTION

## Intro
Accidents are one of the frequent disasters that happen to humans because of human errors.
It is nearly impossible to fully avoid accidents, but we can detect those accidents and get a immediate recovery.
So, we have developed a deep learning model that detects accidents as soon as they happen and alerts the fire station and ambulance.
